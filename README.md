This project is my first attempt to do a Docker Wordpress AngularJS project.

Obviously I have experience in Wordpress.

I have experience in AngularJS

I don't have exprience in Docker, but I love linux, so is something.

Do this shit work with:

`git clone git@github.com:pitakill/docker-wordpress-angularjs.git&&cd docker-wordpress-angularjs&&docker-compose up`

But, you must have docker run in your machine and docker-compose.

```
MySQL:

user: root
password: password
database: wordpress

Wordpress:

user: admin
password: wordpress
email: test@pitakill.net
```
